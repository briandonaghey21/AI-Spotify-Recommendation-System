# WIP AI-Spotify-Recommendation-System <img src="spotify.webp" alt="AI-Spotify-Recommendation-System" width="35">

I'm currently planning to develop an AI-powered Spotify recommendation system that recommends songs/playlists based off of user recommendation and input. For example, they could input "running-vibe playlist", "songs like 'SONG_NAME'", "'SONG_ARTISTS' most popular songs'".

## Roadmap
1. Use ChatGPT to generate songs based off a specfic mood and use the spotify api to display songs
2. Link user's account data with the engine so the recommendations are more personalized
3. Machine learning to optimize the results
4. Front-end
5. Deployment probably with AWS

### Reminders/TODO
- Change redirect URL on deployment
- Postman for easy API testing
- ~~Recommendation is deprecated, come up with a new plan~~ ~~Compare songs based on danceability, tempo, energy, etc., and use that for recommendations https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features~~
- `.giti

# WIP AI-Spotify-Recommendation-System <img src="spotify.webp" alt="AI-Spotify-Recommendation-System" width="35">

I'm currently planning to develop an AI-powered Spotify recommendation system that recommends songs/playlists based off of user recommendation and input. For example, they could input "running-vibe playlist", "songs like 'SONG_NAME'", "'SONG_ARTISTS' most popular songs'".

As I've been creating this project, something interesting I noticed is that openAI really seems to struggle when it comes to asking for song recommendations as it often recommends songs that don't exist. I aim to fix this problem in my project.

## Roadmap
1. Use ChatGPT to generate songs based off a specfic mood and use the spotify api to display songs using reinforcement learning, feedback loops, and nlp 
2. Link user's account data with the engine so the recommendations are more personalized
3. Machine learning to optimize the results
4. Front-end
5. Deployment probably with AWS

### Reminders/TODO
- Create a spotify playlist and send them a link
- Optimize

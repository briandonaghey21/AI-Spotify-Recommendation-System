I developed an AI-powered Spotify recommendation system that recommends songs/playlists based off of user recommendation and input. For example, they could input "running-vibe playlist", "songs like 'SONG_NAME'", "'SONG_ARTISTS' most popular songs'".

As I've been creating this project, something interesting I noticed is that openAI really seems to struggle when it comes to asking for song recommendations as it often recommends songs that don't exist. This proeject solved this issue


### TODO
- Create a spotify playlist and send them a link
- Optimize
